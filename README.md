We have 2 folders with a react app and our own database for audio files.

## How launch project?

### Launch server
1. Open folder with the server __(folder name: Server)__;
2. Write in console `npm i` for loading all node modules;
3. After installation write in console `npm run start:nodemon`

If database started correctly then in console will display:
